# Discord Link

This mod is simply a chat command.
When a user uses the chat command "/discordlink", the server prints "Discord Permalink: https://discord.gg[inserthere]".

Please replace https://discord.gg/SGwQ4v9 in the file "init.lua" with a link of your own (and it shouldn't expire, cause of obvious reasons!)

First used on the Jovark Realms Server.
