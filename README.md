# Discord Link

This mod is simply a set of chat commands which promote a discord server.
**Commands:**
  
  * /discordlink: the server prints "Discord Permalink: https://discord.gg[inserthere]" to the player who ran the command.
  * /discordlink_admin: the server prints "Discord Permalink: https://discord.gg[inserthere]" to all players on the server. *NOTE: privilage 'server' is needed to use this command. *
  * /discordlink_sendto <username>: Any user with discord_link privs can send the link to any player through the chat. Only the recipient of the link can see the link 

Please replace https://discord.gg/SGwQ4v9 in the file "init.lua" with a link of your own (and it shouldn't expire, cause of obvious reasons!)
